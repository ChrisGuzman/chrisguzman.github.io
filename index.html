        <p>I am an enthusiastic learner. After I graduated college I found that I was still eager to educate myself on various topics. Listening to NPR one day, I heard about Udacity. I heard on reddit many times that coding is one of the best skills you can have, and Udacity seemed like a great way to start my learning. I found a passion in web development after taking Udacity’s CS 101 course. I continued to advance my education by enrolling in MOOCs and completing various tutorials.</p>
        <p>When I want to learn something I find it’s best to immerse myself in the subject matter. That’s why I lived, worked, and volunteered in Guatemala for a few months to study Spanish. Similarly, in learning web development I have immersed myself by taking part in hackathons and startup weekends. I listen to podcasts like <a href="http://thisdeveloperslife.com/">This Developer's Life</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/hackernewsnation‎">Hacker News Nation</a>, <a href="http://www.ruby5.envylabs.com">Ruby5</a>, <a href="http://boagworld.com/show/">Boagworld</a>, <a href="http://technical.ly/">Technical.ly's Podcast</a>, and <a href="http://podcasts.thoughtbot.com/giantrobots">Giant Robots Smashing into other Giant Robots</a>.</p>
        <p>The class at <a href="http://www.betamore.com/academy/">Betamore</a>, the hackathons, and the podcasts have truly accelerated my learning. I'm bragging a bit here but my team won <a href="https://bitca.mp">Bitcamp’s Most Impactful Health App</a> for <a href="http://trailblaze.herokuapp.com">Trailblaze</a>, a social gamified life goal tracker. Another team I was on placed third in <a href="http://startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend Lancaster</a> for our travel planning website (still in progress!). I don't think any of this would be possible without the efforts I've taken to immerse myself.</p>

        <p>I attended the <a href="http://technical.ly/baltimore/2014/02/10/baltimore-tech-startups-hiring/">NET/WORK Baltimore</a> event on Thursday, February 20th. I'm not currently looking for a job, but I may be after the Betamore course ends. So I figured <em>I </em>would interview the <em>recruiters</em> about how I can make myself a more appealing candidate. Here are some questions I thought appropriate:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>What do you want in a back end developer?</li>
          <li>What do you need to be considered full stack?</li>
          <li>What should I be making to impress you?</li>
          <li>How can I get your attention, get in touch with you?</li>
          <li>I’m learning X, what else should I learn?</li>
          <li>What internship or freelance opportunities are there?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The answer I got back from many of recruiters was the same advice anyone will hear if they're looking to get started in web development: make something! More specifically make something and talk about it. Start a blog (<a href="http://www.chrisguzman.github.io">check</a>) and a twitter (<a href="https://www.twitter.com/speaktochris">check</a>). Update your LinkedIn (<a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/guzmantchris/">check</a>), GitHub (<a href="https://www.github.com/ChrisGuzman/">check</a>) and attend meetups (check). You should be talking about what you're learning and what you're making on all of these networks!</p>

<p>We spent class time completing the entire <a href="http://gitimmersion.com/">Git Immersion</a> tutorial. Going over git immersion with an instructor is <em>very</em> helpful. The tutorial doesn’t answer all of your questions and you will get stuck. But one rule I'm forcing myself to follow is to not ask for help unless I've spent more than 15 mintues trying to solve the problem on my own. It's a strategy I picked up from another blogger who attended a different bootcamp.</p>

<p>Some strategies I picked up doing the Git Immersion tutorial:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use git status a lot</li>
  <li>When lost type "cat hello.rb" into the command line to see what state the hello.rb program is in.
  </li>
  <li>The tutorial doesn't tell you, but you should use sublime to edit and save the programs during the git immersion tutorial.
  </li>
  <li>If you get lost or messed up or want to see how things should be done, then navigate to the repos folder in the folder you downloaded at the beginning of the tutorial. You can then use that to pick up from an earlier lesson</li>
  <li>Don’t get distracted while you do the tutorial! Both of the mistakes I can identify that made me start over or start from a previous lesson were because I checked my email or goofed around on spotify.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some random advice from Paul: He uses bitbucket for personal, non open source projects- it's private hosting of git repositories for free. He recommend we consider checking out all of the stuff at <a href="pragprog.com">The Pragmatic Bookshelf</a> including <a href="http://pragprog.com/screencasts/v-jwsceasy/source-control-made-easy">the video about git.</a>

<p>Paul showed us how he sets up his dev environment which includes:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text 3</a></li>
<li><a href="iterm2.com">iTerm (terminal replacement)</a></li>
<li><a href="brew.sh">Homebrew</a></li>
<li>
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/">Xcode</a>

<ul>
<li>Note: I had to troubleshoot homebrew and xcode on my own. Which was a learning experience I definitely recommend to everyone. It prepares you for the future and is so much more satisfying when you find the solution.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="alfredapp.com">Alfred (spotlight replacement)</a></li>
<li>Git and github</li>
</ul><p>The general layout of the course will be a flipped classroom. We will go over lessons outside of class and then code in class with our mentor. So they definitely encourage learning on your own.</p>

<p>I plan on learning more ruby on my own with <a href="codeschool.com">code school</a> and <a href="ruby.learncodethehardway.org">Learn Ruby The Hard Way</a>.</p>
