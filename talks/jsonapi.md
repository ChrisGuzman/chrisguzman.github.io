---

```bash
#Sort articles alphabetically by title
GET /articles/?sort=title

#Sort authors by name, then life
GET /authors?sort=name,alive

#Sort authors by reverse alphabetical order, then life
GET /authors?sort=-name,alive
```

_Note: JSON API is agnostic about how the sort query parameter can be used._

---

```bash
#Get the third of 13 pages, one article at a time
GET /articles?page[number]=3&page[size]=1 HTTP/1.1

"links": {
  "self": "http://example.com/articles?page[number]=3&page[size]=1",

  "next": "http://example.com/articles?page[number]=4&page[size]=1",
  "last": "http://example.com/articles?page[number]=13&page[size]=1"
}
```

_Note: JSON API is agnostic about how the page query parameter can be used._
